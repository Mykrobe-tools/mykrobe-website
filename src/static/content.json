It has been heavily validated on thousands of samples, is free, no expertise is needed to run or interpret it, and it works offline, on a standard desktop or laptop.\n## What sequencers does Mykrobe support?\nMykrobe supports both the traditional sequencing machine (Illumina), which tends to need a large hospital or lab and a lot of infrastructure, and also the new handheld sequencers (nanopore), which are very portable, and moving towards production readiness.\n## Where is Mykrobe used?"
